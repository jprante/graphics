This is a modified version of Craig Burke's document-builder at

https://github.com/craigburke/document-builder

extended by a `DocumentAnalyzer` which can examine PDF documents by using Apache PdfBox https://pdfbox.apache.org

This library will be extended by useful PDF classes with an emphasis on Groovy.
